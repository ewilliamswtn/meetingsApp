Translation of white board pseudocode into javascript

## First Section, lines 1-23:
This section represents an attempt to translate pseudocode from the white board into more clear/legible javascipt. 
I have attempted to change as little as possible. Names may have been changed for the sake of clarity, but there
was no attempt made to fix any errors.

## Second Section, lines 34-84:
This section is the exact same code as the previous section, with comments added. Comments are an attempt to explain
what my code was attempting to accomplish, and the thought process behind the code.

## Third section, lines 95-107:
In laying out my pseduocode in actual javascript, errors I made became apparent. This section accounts for the flaws
I noticed in my approach.
