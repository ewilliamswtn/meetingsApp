Translation of whiteboard pseudocode into javascript

## First Section, lines 1-29:
This section represents an attempt to translate pseudocode from the whiteboard into more clear/legible javascipt. 
I have attempted to change as little as possible. Names may have been changed for the sake of clarity, but generally,
there was no attempt made to fix any perceived errors.

## Second Section, lines 40-98:
This section is the exact same code as the previous section, with comments added. Comments are an attempt to explain
what my code was attempting to accomplish, and the thought process behind the code

## Third section, lines 109-126:
In laying out my pseduocode in actual javascript, errors I made became apparent. This section accounts for the flaws
I noticed in my approach.
